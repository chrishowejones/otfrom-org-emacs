* helm-mode

  helm-mode is the succesor to anything.el. I don't really have my
  head around it all yet, but I'm already pretty impressed with it so
  I'll include it here and add more to it as I understand what is
  going on.

  My helm-mode guru is Kris Jenkins [[http://twitter.com/krisajenkins][@krisajenkins]].
