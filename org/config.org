* non-elpa files

  Unfortunately, we can't get everything we want from the package
  archives or we might have files that we're working on locally that
  we haven't released yet. We keep those in a non-elpa directory. We
  need to add this to the load-path so that we can require the files
  we have here.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/non-elpa/")
  #+END_SRC
* helm-mode

  helm-mode is the succesor to anything.el. I don't really have my
  head around it all yet, but I'm already pretty impressed with it so
  I'll include it here and add more to it as I understand what is
  going on.

  My helm-mode guru is Kris Jenkins [[http://twitter.com/krisajenkins][@krisajenkins]].
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (maybe-install-and-require 'helm)
    (helm-mode 1)
  #+END_SRC
  
* git

  magit is a *fantastic* mode for dealing with git.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (maybe-install-and-require 'magit)
  #+END_SRC
