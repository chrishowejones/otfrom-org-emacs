* Introduction

  I was inspired by [[https://github.com/t-ob/dotfiles][Tom O'Brien's dotfiles]] to do a org-mode version of
  my emacs config. I also completely broke my emacs config trying to
  do some other things and I figured I should fix it properly rather
  than just getting the basics back together.

  The real content is in [[./org/config.org][config.org]], which would probably be more
  interesting to read.
